# CS210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project a specific set of functional requirements, to create the ability to display two clocks. A 12 and a 24 hour one.
#What did you do particularly well?
I thought I would have trouble creating the menu from the supporting material but it worked surprisingly well.
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could certainly clean up this code a bit, for it to be more visually solid.
#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did find this challenging, it was a lot of trial and error. I asked for advice from my support system for help when I was stuck.
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This is sort of vague. I think all of this is transferable. Writing anything is always helping improve your skill and will be good for future work.
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This is hard to tell. As the author, it is easy to think you have written something readable, for example. I suppose in this case I would go by my recieved feedback.
